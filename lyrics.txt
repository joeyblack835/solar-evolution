BIRTH OF THE STAR

Sometimes a star appears
To bring the light for long, long years
Bright, bright, take your time
Fly, fly up to the sky

RED GIANT

Mother weather, make haste
Bring us water
A drought came to our place
Now it's getting hotter

A red giant is near
And that's dried the rains
There's nowhere to flee
Now all is in flames

WHITE DWARF

And in the end the star is done
Its remnant starts a final run
White, white with fading light
Fly, fly across the sky
